To remove the `node_modules` directory from your repository after it has been pushed, follow these steps:

1. Remove the `node_modules` directory from the repository's tracking:
    ```bash
    git rm -r --cached node_modules
    ```

2. Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Remove node_modules from repository"
    ```

3. Push the changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

4. Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `node_modules/` to prevent it from being tracked again.
